# Face Mask Detection
Upload an image or video to detect whether you or someone else is wearing a face mask!

## Description
The Face Mask Detection where it uses facial and object recognition to accurately distinguish those with or without masks. The user would upload an image and the program would analyze it and output whether or not they're wearing a mask. This project is needed to prevent higher risk of spreading the coronavirus and to enforce those who don't follow proper guidelines to wear a mask.

## Creator
Hello! My name is Kim, a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I have many interests but currently, I want to explore more in the field of robotics, artificial intelligence, and front-end development. Outside of coding, I love to do digital design, gaming, hanging out with friends, and streaming on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/akzelea)! I also have a personal website [here](http://kimhoangdo.com/) if you would like to know more about me.

### Why I Created this Project
I created this project because I wanted to address the problem with people not following the guidelines for wearing face-masks during a global pandemic. It saddens me to see those not putting on masks when needed in public because it causes a higher risk of spreading the virus even more. Thus, I created this project to encourage and enforce people to wear one.

Another reason why I created this project is because like most college students, we want to be able to attend in-person classes as soon as possible and the only way we can go back to our college campuses is for the number of COVID cases to die down. Therefore, I felt that like a project like this can simulate technology that can benefit those who are trying to prevent the virus from spreading as much as possible.
